comp-debug-bin		addr2line - translates program addresses into file names and line
comp-debug-bin		execution profile of C, Pascal, or Fortran77 programs.
comp-debug-bin		gcov - displays basic block profile / coverage data, if requested
comp-debug-bin		gdb - is the GNU debugger. The purpose of a debugger such as GDB
comp-debug-bin		gprof - displays call graph profile data. gprof produces an
comp-debug-bin		how often each basic block is executed; 
comp-debug-bin		information in the executable to figure out which file name and
comp-debug-bin		instrumentation into the object files it generates, which measure

comp-debug-bin		numbers. Given an address and an executable, it uses the debugging
comp-debug-bin		via the C compiler gcc(1) command line options -fprofile-arcs and
comp-debug-bin		while it executes, or what another program was doing at the moment
