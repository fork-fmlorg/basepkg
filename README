basepkg is developing in GitHub (https://github.com/user340/basepkg).

Please contact to Yuuki Enomoto <uki@e-yuuki.org> for bug-report, question,
discussion, donation of patches and others. Or you can use GitHub issues and
pull-requests for these things.

===============================================================================
1. Usage
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1. Build the NetBSD distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this procedure, NetBSD source tree is in /usr/src, NetBSD build-tools is in
/usr/tools, NetBSD compiled objects is in /usr/obj, NetBSD version is 7.1.2,
machine is amd64, and machine archtecture is x86_64.

How to build NetBSD source tree is here. Don't read if you understand or done
it.

First, download NetBSD source sets. Then extract it to /usr/src directory.

    # ftp ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-7.1.2/source/
    ...
    ftp> mget .tgz
    ...
    ftp> bye
    # ls | grep 'tgz$' | xargs -n 1 -I % tar zxf -C /
    # ls | grep 'tgz$' | xargs rm

Second, build it using build.sh.

    # mkdir /usr/obj /usr/tools
    # cd /usr/src
    # ./build.sh -O ../obj -T ../tools -x -X ../xsrc tools
    # ./build.sh -O ../obj -T ../tools -x -X ../xsrc distribution

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2. Install pkgtools/pkg_install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

basepkg(1) is tested by latest pkgtools/pkg_install[1]. I recommend that
install it from pkgsrc(7).

How to get pkgsrc(7) is here. Don't read if you understand or done it.

    # ftp ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/stable/pkgsrc.tar.gz
    # tar zxf pkgsrc.tar.gz -C /usr
    # rm pkgsrc.tar.gz

Run make(1) with "install clean clean-depends" targets on pkgtools/pkg_install.

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkg_install
    # make install clean clean-depends

Or we can use pkgin(1) instead of pkgsrc(7). pkgin is a binary package manager
for pkgsrc(7)[2].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.3. Run basepkg.sh
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run basepkg.sh(1) with pkg and kern option.

    # ./basepkg.sh pkg
    # ./basepkg.sh kern

Packages are created under the
packages/<release-version>/<machine>-<machine_arch> directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4. How to install package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running pkg_add(1) with "-K var/db/basepkg" for separate database from
pkgsrc(7).

    # pkg_add -K /var/db/basepkg games-games-bin-7.1.tgz

But etc categorized packages are exception. They are installed to
/var/tmp/basepkg because the way keeps from overwrite existing files under the
/etc. If you want to update the configuration files, please run etcupdate(8)
manually.

    # etcupdate -s /var/tmp/basepkg

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5. pkgsrc-wip
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

basepkg(1) is imported to pkgsrc-wip[3]. You can install basepkg to your system
using pkgsrc-wip. But it supporting only latest version package.

    # cd /usr/pkgsrc/wip/basepkg
    # make install clean clean-depends

basepkg.sh(1), README and others are installed to /usr/pkg/basepkg. You can run
basepkg.sh(1) on /usr/pkg/basepkg directory. Packages are placed in
/usr/pkg/basepkg/packages directory.

===============================================================================
2. Background
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. syspkgs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NetBSD Wiki described, "syspkgs is the concept of using pkgsrc's pkg_* tools to
maintain the base system. ... There has been a lot of work in this area
already, but it has not yet been finalized."[4]

basepkg is intend to become a successor to syspkg. But basepkg is third-party
software less like syspkg. It is an unofficial project of NetBSD.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Goal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We intend to efficient base system management by package on NetBSD. The way of
update NetBSD base system are (1) build.sh and (2) download tarballs from FTP
server. But the first way takes a long time to compile source tree. The second
way is dengerous. 

A lot of Linux distributions (GNU/Linux) such as Debian and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) has the very fast mothod of updating own system. It is "package"
and "package manager". GNU/Linux and BSD Unix has different background about
histories and the way of distribute. It is difficult to make simple comparisons
for this reason. However "package" have been active for more than 20 years.
Management of whole/part of the system is very easy in GNU/Linux.

So we decided to use "package" for NetBSD base system. It is difficult as the
example of syspkg illustrates. But it will provides benefit for NetBSD users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3. Presentations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The presentations about basepkg(1) are here.

===============================================================================
3. TODO
===============================================================================

* Develop the auto update mechanism for "sets" (including comments, deps,
  lists, and others).
* Review +INSTALL and +DEINSTALL.
* Support pkgin(1).
* Provide package repository for pkgin(1).
* Support "source package" like as source RPM.
* Research "package" background from a viewpoint of Unix community, internet,
  and others.
* Improve documentation (including online manual, guidebook for develop,
  about basepkg architecture, ...).
* Import to pkgsrc from pkgsrc-wip.
